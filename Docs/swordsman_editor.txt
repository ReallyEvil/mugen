Attack Speed			= Attack duration in seconds
X Velocity Factor		= Multiplied with gesture lenth to give velocity along the x axis
X Velocity Max			= Maximum velocity along the x axis
X Decelerate			= Velocity along the x axis is declerated by this when there is no input
X Decelerate Change Dir	= Velocity along the x axis is declerated by this when there is a change in direction
Gravity					= Why the swordsman is not a spaceman
Jump Angle Min			= Minimum gesture angle required before a jump is registered
Jupm Angle Factor		= Multiplied with jump angle velocity along the y axis
Jump Height Max			= Maxium jump height (TODO)
Jump Consecutive		= Consequective jumps allowed before hitting the ground
Move Gesture Radius		= Radius from the swordsman gestures need to start within
