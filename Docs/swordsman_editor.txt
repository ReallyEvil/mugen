Slash Speed					= Attack duration in seconds
Slash Velocity Y			= Y velocity added to when the swordsman is slashing and falling
Slash Velocity X			= X velocity added to when the swordsman is slashing
Slash Velocity X Zero Delta	= X velocity decreased towards zero when the swordsman is slashing
X Velocity Factor Ground	= Multiplied with gesture lenth to give velocity along the x axis when on the ground
X Velocity Factor Air		= Multiplied with gesture lenth to give velocity along the x axis when in the air
X Velocity Max				= Maximum velocity along the x axis
X Acceleration Max			= Maximum acceleration along the x axis
Friction					= Reduces velocity along the x axis when on the ground
Friction Change Dir			= Reduces velocity along the x axis when there is a change in direction
Gravity						= Why the swordsman is not a spaceman
Jump Angle Min				= Minimum gesture angle required before a jump is registered
Jupm Factor					= Multiplied with the jump gesture direction and then added to the velocity to jump
Jump Height Max				= Maxium jump height (TODO)
Jump Consecutive			= Consequective jumps allowed before hitting the ground
Move Gesture Radius			= Radius from the swordsman gestures need to start within
Min Action Gesture			= Action gestures are ignored if their distance is less than this
Dash Velocity				= X velocity of the dash
Dash Period					= Period which the player is dashing and cannot be interrupted with another dash
Dash Invincible Period		= Period which the player is invincible, starting from the beginning of the dash
Dash Input Period			= Dash taps need to be within this period
