- Need to change dash action; attack action is interferring with dash action.
	- Change dash action from double tap to double swipe from the move guesture area.
	- Apply to air dashing as well - note that the air dash travels in a straight path, with gravity only taking effect 	  after the dashing sequence.

- The dash invincibility doesn't work - still taking damage.

- We need swordie and grunt health.

- We need grunt attack pattern.

- We need something to indicate the direction that all characters are facing as we need to also simulate the direction sensitive attack inputs.

- Magnify the swordie's attack angles to 45 degress.

- Jumping still doesn't feel right, especially when jumping at angle. Will need to discuss this in person.

- We need something to simulate player's progress through the tower. At the moment we can get away with indicating the wave number of enemy spawn.

- Need to make separate parameters for air dashing; cant reuse ground dash properties.

- Modify ground dash properties: create properties for Dash Distance and Invincibility Period to replace Dash Velocity and Dash Period.

- Need Jumping Power.

- REMINDER: Playable prototype to be done before 7/7/2012; 9/7/2012 at the latest as per meeting minutes taken on 17/06/2012.

- Enemies for Proof of concept: "Grunt", "Archer Grunt", "Big Grunt"
	- All enemies should have a detection distance, visable attack patterns and MAYBE defined max health.

==Agenda for Friday 6/07/2012==

- Complete Airdashing
	- Separate parameters from ground dash

- Grunt enemy attack pattern and spawn point

- Platforming collision detection

- Tuttorial screen
