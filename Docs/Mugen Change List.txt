- Need to change dash action; attack action is interferring with dash action.
	- Change dash action from double tap to double swipe from the move guesture area.
	- Apply to air dashing as well - note that the air dash travels in a straight path, with gravity only taking effect 	  after the dashing sequence.

- The dash invincibility doesn't work - still taking damage.

- We need swordie and grunt health.

- We need grunt attack pattern.

- We need something to indicate the direction that all characters are facing as we need to also simulate the direction sensitive attack inputs.

- Magnify the swordie's attack angles to 45 degress.

- Jumping still doesn't feel right, especially when jumping at angle. Will need to discuss this in person.

- We need something to simulate player's progress through the tower. At the moment we can get away with indicating the wave number of enemy spawn.

- REMINDER: Playable prototype to be done before 7/7/2012; 9/7/2012 at the latest as per meeting minutes taken on 17/06/2012.
